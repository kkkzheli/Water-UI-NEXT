网易:
NetEase:

直塞vanilla_netease, 但不能要本包的manifest.json文件。网易部分内容不适配, 需删除ui文件夹下的chat_screen.json和progress_screen.json文件以及font文件夹。网易越改越恶心, 这些内容不适配我也无能为力。
Directly insert into vanilla_netease, but do not include the manifest.json file from this pack. Some parts are not compatible with NetEase version, so you must delete chat_screen.json and progress_screen.json from the ui folder, as well as the font folder. NetEase keeps making things worse, and I can’t do anything about the incompatibility of these contents.

基岩版:
Bedrock Edition:

最佳适配版本: 1.18.10
Best compatible version: 1.18.10

高于1.18.10可能会有一点点不兼容现象, 但问题不是很大。
Versions higher than 1.18.10 may have slight compatibility issues, but they are not severe.

懒人自定义功能:
Lazy User Customization Features:

本资源包很贴心的附赠了自定义功能, 可以非常方便的去除一些你不想要的内容。也可以自定义字体。网易必须将字体改为smooth！
This resource pack thoughtfully includes customization features that allow you to easily remove unwanted content. You can also customize the font. NetEase must change the font to smooth!

使用方法:
How to use:

1. 搜索文件_global_variables.json
1. Locate the file _global_variables.json

2. 打开后看注释里的提示修改相应内容, 特别注意字体修改要保证输入的文件名准确无误, 注意大小写, 不能包含后缀！
2. Open it and follow the instructions in the comments to modify the relevant content. Be especially careful when changing the font: make sure the file name is exact, case-sensitive, and must not include the file extension!

3. 自定义音乐必须导入kkkzheli提供的附加包并按照指示修改。(需要先装在NEXT 1.1版本及以上的主包才生效)
3. For custom music, you must import the additional pack provided by kkkzheli and modify it according to the instructions. (This will only work with NEXT version 1.1 or higher.)
